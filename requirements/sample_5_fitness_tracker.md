# Fitness Tracker Application Requirements

## Project Overview

I want a fitness tracking app that helps users monitor their workouts, nutrition, and health goals. Think Fitbit app or MyFitnessPal but more focused.

### Workout Tracking

**Exercise Logging:**
- Log different types of workouts (running, cycling, weightlifting, yoga, etc.)
- Track duration, distance, calories burned
- For strength training: log exercises, sets, reps, weight
- Save workout templates for quick logging
- View workout history and progress over time

**Activity Goals:**
- Set daily step goals
- Set weekly workout targets
- Track active minutes
- Progress bars showing goal completion

### Nutrition Tracking

**Food Logging:**
- Search food database or scan barcodes
- Log meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
- Track calories, protein, carbs, fats
- Set daily calorie goals
- View nutrition summary for the day

**Meal Planning:**
- Save favorite meals

- Meal planning calendar (optional)
