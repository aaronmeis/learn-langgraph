# Task Management Application Requirements

## What I'm Looking For

I want a simple task management app for my team. Something like Trello but customized for our workflow.

### Core Functionality

**Task Management:**
- Create tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
- Assign tasks to team members
- Organize tasks into projects or categories
- Mark tasks as complete/in-progress/blocked
- Add comments and attachments to tasks

**Team Collaboration:**
- User accounts with roles (Admin, Manager, Member)
- Notifications when tasks are assigned or updated
- Activity feed showing what team members are working on
- File sharing for documents related to tasks

**Reporting:**
- Dashboard showing task completion rates
- Burndown charts for projects
- Time tracking (optional - nice to have)
- Export reports to PDF or Excel

### Technical Specs

- Web-based application (accessible from any browser)
- Mobile app would be great but web-first is fine
- Real-time updates when team members make changes
- Integration with email for notifications
- Cloud storage for files (or local storage, either works)

### Must-Have Features

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
3. Search and filter tasks
4. Drag-and-drop task organization
5. Email notifications

### Nice-to-Have Features

- Calendar view of tasks
- Gantt charts for project timelines
- Integration with Slack or Microsoft Teams
- Time tracking and billing
- Custom workflows and automation

### Constraints

- Must work with teams of 5-50 people
- Data should be secure and private
- Should be intuitive - minimal training required
- Budget is limited, so prefer open-source solutions where possible
